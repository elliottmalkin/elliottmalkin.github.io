       <br>Juneway Beach is a short, narrow stretch of shoreline on Lake Michigan in Chicago. It is a haven where otherwise, on all sides, the city impinges upon the water: Sheridan Road curves out and around a cemetery and over a landfill to the north; apartment blocks hang over the water to the south.<br><br>

Sitting on the terrace above the small beach, one can comfortably see its extent, even while staring directly over the gently lapping waves and into the expanse of the great lake, out where the water meets the horizon. The beachgoer first captures the presence of the beach here from the terrace, but to appreciate it fully, he appreciates its parts, by strolling along the shoreline, focusing on the pebbles below or at the seagulls hovering above. The beach unfolds, and as it does, the beachgoer continually shifts his angle of view and degree of focus.<br><br>

&ldquo;Juneway Beach&rdquo; is a name that makes the beach discrete in the beachgoer&rsquo;s mind. And this discreteness is reinforced by a fence that marks the beach as a piece of land. It has finality, he thinks, both physically and conceptually, even if on one side it is not clear where Juneway Beach ends and Lake Michigan begins, as the sand slopes further below the water. Perhaps this last boundary is determined by where the waves begin to break, or on a still day, out where the beachgoer loses his toehold on the lake bottom.<br><br>

The beachgoer wonders if the beach is whole or merely an aggregation of its parts. If he were to account for every pebble on the shore, every grain of sand, he must then account for every molecule, every atom, ad infinitum, and then the beach loses its definition. It bleeds in all directions, far beyond the seagull.<br><br>

This ontology of beach poses a problem when one seeks to recreate it. It is possible to reproduce the beach just as it unfolds to the beachgoer, as a <b><a href="Javascript:openpopWindow('juneway.html','example','width=260,height=220,left=300,top=120,resizable=no,scrollbars=no')" return true">video</a></b>: one angle, one view, one degree of magnification at a time. Video mimics our eyes in its singularity of perspective, and because of this we rely upon montage to splice together its parts, just as the beachgoer constructs Juneway Beach from its pebbles. Maybe that is why we so readily take to video: because our minds already work like this, by constructing wholes from parts.<br><br>
